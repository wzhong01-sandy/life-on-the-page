            <div class="text">LA FRANTUMAGLIA</div>
            <div class="text">
                My mother left me a word in her dialect that she used to describe how she felt when she was racked by 
                contradictory sensations that were tearing her apart. She said that inside her she had a <em>frantumaglia</em>, a jumble of fragments.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                The frantumaglia depressed her. Sometimes it made her dizzy, sometimes it made her mouth taste like iron. 
                It was the word for a disquiet not otherwise definable, it referred to a miscellaneous crowd of things in her head, 
                debris in a muddy water of the brain. The frantumaglia was mysterious, it provoked mysterious actions, 
                it was the source of all suffering not traceable to a single obvious cause. 
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                …What frantumaglia was I didn’t know and still don't. Today I have in my mind a catalogue of images, 
                but they have more to do with my problems than with hers. The frantumaglia is an unstable landscape, 
                an infinite aerial or aquatic mass of debris that appears to the I, brutally, as its true and unique inner self.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                The frantumaglia is the storehouse of time without the orderliness of a history, a story. The frantumaglia is an effect 
                of the sense of loss, when we’re sure that everything that seems to us stable, lasting, an anchor for our life, 
                will soon join that landscape of debris that we seem to see. The frantumaglia is to perceive with excruciating anguish 
                the heterogeneous crowd from which we, living, raise our voice, and the heterogeneous crowd into which it is fated to vanish. 
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                I…represent it to myself mainly as a hum growing louder and a vortex-like fracturing of material living and dead…But 
                it’s also…a bright-colored explosion of sounds, thousands and thousands of butterflies with sonorous wings. 
                Or it’s only my way of describing the anguish of death, the fear that the capacity to express myself would get stuck—
                as if the organs of speech had been paralyzed—and everything I’d learned to control, from the first year of life until now, 
                would start fluctuating on its own, dripping or hissing out of a body becoming a thing, a leather sack leaking air and liquids.

            <div class="text">THE NECESSARY OTHER</div>
            <div class="text">
                …Completely by chance, I returned to a book, published by Feltrinelli, that I had read when it came out, 
                in 1997 or 1998: <em>Tu che mi guardi, tu che mi racconti</em> (published in English in 2000 as Relating Narratives: 
                Storytelling and Selfhood), by Adriana Cavarero… I was trying to get out of the dead end of <em>The Lost Daughter</em> 
                by drafting a new story of mothers and daughters—a crowded, expansive story that, in my intention, 
                would span some seventy years—when I picked up Cavarero’s book again.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                It seemed new, a book I had never read, starting from the use she makes of Karen Blixen and the story of the stork, 
                recounted in Out of Africa. But what kindled my imagination was an expression: the necessary other. 
                It serves as the title of an entire chapter, is set up by a complex dialogue with Hannah Arendt, skirts the theme of narcissism, 
                and arrives, finally, at the following definition:
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                “The necessary other is…a finitude that remains irremediably an other in all the fragile and unjudgeable insubstitutability of her existing.”
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                It was, I recall, a shock. An other seemed to me what I needed 
                in order to leave the three earlier books and yet stay within them.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                But I want to proceed in order. Among the many books Cavarero used to advance her argument, she cited, at a certain point, 
                <em>Non credere di avere dei diritti</em> (published in English as Sexual Difference: A Theory of Social-Symbolic Practice), 
                an extremely important Italian feminist text, published by the Milan Women’s Bookstore Collective.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                From it she extrapolated a brief story of friendship. It was an encounter between two women, Emilia and Amalia, 
                against the background of the 1970s and the “150 hours,” a union victory giving workers the right to a hundred and fifty hours of courses, 
                or similar activities, that furthered their personal development…
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                …I had read Sexual Difference many years earlier and hadn’t really noticed Emilia and Amalia. But Cavarero extracted those pale figures of women 
                from the two pages or so that concerned them and spoke about them with great sensitivity and intelligence…
                I even found a passage that Cavarero hadn’t quoted directly, but that fired my imagination. 
                Amalia, the good writer, at a certain point says of Emilia: “This woman truly understood things: 
                she wrote a lot of sentences that were disconnected but very true and profound.” 
                I immediately liked that “truly.” I liked that “true and profound.” I felt that Amalia, who loved to write and knew she was good at it, 
                had an uncontainable admiration for Emilia’s attempts to write. It seemed to me that I could even perceive a feeling like envy 
                in the face of a result that, though she was good, Amalia knew she couldn’t achieve.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                I began to exaggerate, as I typically do. Cavarero writes: “We do not come to know the adored pages that Emilia preserves in her handbag.”
                …And I imagined—I thought—that if I had at least Amalia’s text I would be able to discern Emilia’s true and profound sentences rising up in it.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                I’m almost positive that the dynamic between Elena’s writing and Lila’s came to me from those thoughts. 
                In fact I’d only had to read Amalia’s admiring words and right away, I confess, her friend’s “disconnected sentences” had become “true writing,” 
                the writing that bursts in (Dante would have described it: “almost as if it moved of its own accord”) and ends up beautifully enclosed between 
                the red lines of a notebook. In other words, I imagined that Amalia, with her ability to write, had tamed Emilia’s fragments, and that Emilia, 
                the necessary other, was happy precisely about that taming.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                …It’s probably starting here that the relationship between Lenù and Lila, and between their writing, became clearer to me. 
                And it’s probably starting here that I began to think that I could leave Olga, Delia, and especially Leda by working on 
                a sort of mutual necessary otherness, describing, that is, a bond between two people merged with one another but 
                not reducible to one another.
